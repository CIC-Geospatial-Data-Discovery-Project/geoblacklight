# Geoblacklight

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/geoblacklight/geoblacklight.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/geoblacklight/geoblacklight) | [![Coverage Status](https://img.shields.io/coveralls/geoblacklight/geoblacklight.svg)](https://coveralls.io/r/geoblacklight/geoblacklight?branch=coveralls)

GeoBlacklight is a world-class discovery platform for geospatial (GIS) holdings. It
is an open collaborative project aiming to build off of the successes
of the Blacklight Solr-powered discovery interface and the
multi-institutional OpenGeoportal federated metadata sharing
communities. We're actively looking for community input and development partners.
