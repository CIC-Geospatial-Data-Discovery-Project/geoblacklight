GeoBlacklight is a world-class discovery platform for geospatial (GIS) holdings. It
is an open collaborative project aiming to build off of the successes
of the Blacklight Solr-powered discovery interface and the
multi-institutional OpenGeoportal federated metadata sharing
communities. We are currently in a collaborative design phase and
we're actively looking for community input and development partners.
More coming soon!
